However, it's important to check the current date and time to determine if Daylight Saving Time is in effect, as it can vary.\n\nTo get the current time in Kauai, Hawaii, you would subtract 10 hours from the UTC time or subtract 11 hours from the UTC time, depending on whether Daylight Saving Time is being observed. For the most accurate information, consult a reliable time zone converter or a current time source that accounts for Daylight Saving Time adjustments.",
