For example, in question 1, you're missing the context of the question.  You need to understand the question's intent and the relationship between the provided information and the question.\n* **Specificity:**  You're sometimes too general in your answers.  For example, in question 2, you're saying \"Yes\" to the question, but you're not providing a specific answer.  You need to be more specific in your answers.\n* **Contextualization:**  You're not always providing enough context for your answers.  For example, in question 3, you're saying \"No\" to the question, but you're not explaining why.  You need to provide more context for your answers.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Expand on the Reasoning:**  When you're saying \"No\" to a question, provide a more detailed explanation of why you think the answer is insufficient.\n2. **Provide More Context:**  When you're saying \"Yes\" to a question, provide more context for your answer.  For example, in question 2, you could say something like, \"The provided knowledge triplets only provide information about the person who said \"Taste cannot be controlled by law,\" which is Thomas Jefferson.
