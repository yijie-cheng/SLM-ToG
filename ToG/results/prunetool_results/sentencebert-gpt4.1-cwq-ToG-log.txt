Q: {}
What Portuguese=speaking country had the net migration number of -10000?

Knowledge Triplets: A: 

RESULT: 
Based on the question, we are looking for a Portuguese-speaking country with a net migration number of -10,000. However, the provided knowledge triplets are empty ({}), so there is no direct information given about any country's net migration or language.

Using general knowledge:
- The main Portuguese-speaking countries are: Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, East Timor, Equatorial Guinea, and São Tomé and Príncipe.
- Net migration numbers can vary by year, but a net migration of -10,000 is relatively modest and could fit a smaller Portuguese-speaking country.

Without specific triplets, we cannot definitively answer which country had this exact net migration number. If you provide the relevant triplets (for example, {Country, location.country.official_language, Portuguese} and {Country, location.country.net_migration, -10000}), I could give a precise answer.

Therefore, based on the current information, the answer cannot be determined from the given knowledge triplets.
