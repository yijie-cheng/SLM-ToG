- **Provide proactive information:** Google Now used "cards" to show relevant information before you asked, such as weather, traffic updates, sports scores, and news.
- **Reminders:** Set reminders for times, places, or recurring events.
- **Voice search:** Answer questions and perform actions via voice commands (e.g., "What's the weather?", "Set an alarm for 7 AM").
- **Calendar integration:** Show upcoming appointments, flight information, and event reminders.
- **Traffic and commute updates:** Notify you about traffic conditions and suggest alternate routes.
- **Package tracking:** Show shipping updates for packages based on your email receipts.
- **Travel assistance:** Provide information about nearby attractions, currency exchange rates, and translation help when traveling.
- **Sports updates:** Deliver scores and news about your favorite teams.
- **News and interests:** Show news stories based on your interests and search history.
- **Location-based suggestions:** Suggest nearby restaurants, attractions, or events.

Google Now was designed to anticipate your needs and provide information automatically, without you having to search for it. Most of these features have since been integrated into Google Assistant and the Google app’s "Feed" or "Discover" section.
