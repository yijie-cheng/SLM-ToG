Q: Which of the seven Central American countries had co2 emissions per capita once of 2009 metric ton?
A:

RESULT: 
First, we need to identify the countries in Central America. They are: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Belize. Second, we need to find the country with CO2 emissions per capita of 2009 metric tons. Without specific data, it's hard to pinpoint a country exactly, but generally, the emissions per capita can vary significantly based on economic activities, energy mix, and population size. For example, Costa Rica has been known for its efforts in renewable energy, which might affect its emissions per capita. Without specific data for each country in 2009, it's not possible to definitively answer this question. However, Costa Rica is often mentioned for its environmental efforts and might have lower emissions per capita compared to other countries globally, but without exact figures, we cannot specify which country had exactly 2009 metric tons of CO2 emissions per capita.
