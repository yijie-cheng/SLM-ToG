RESULT: 
I'm happy to help!

For the first question, the three relations that contribute to the answer are:

language.human_language.main_country; language.human_language.countries_spoken_in; base.rosetta.languoid.parent

I would rate their contribution as follows:

1. language.human_language.main_country (Score: 0.5) - This relation is the most relevant as it directly answers the question about the president of the country where Brahui is the main spoken language.
2. language.human_language.countries_spoken_in (Score: 0.3) - This relation is also relevant as it provides additional information on the countries where Brahui is spoken, which could help narrow down the search.
3. base.rosetta.languoid.parent (Score: 0.2) - This relation is less relevant as it provides general information on the language family, but it's still useful in understanding the context of the language.

The sum of the scores is 1.

For the second question, since there is no topic entity provided, I assume you meant to ask about Michael Jordan. The two relations that contribute to the answer are:

base.popstra.canoodled.date; base.popstra.canoodled.participant

I would rate their contribution as follows:

1. base.popstra.canoodled.date (Score: 0.7) - This relation is more relevant as it provides information on the specific date when Michael Jordan attended a school, which could be useful in answering the question.
2. base.popstra.canoodled.participant (Score: 0.3) - This relation is less relevant as it only provides general information on the participants involved, but it's still useful in understanding the context of the event.

The sum of the scores is 1.

Relation: base.aareas.schema.administrative_area.administrative_children
Entites: Autonomous Republic of Crimea; Cherkasy Oblast; Sevastopol; Ternopil Oblast; Zhytomyr Oblast
Score: 

RESULT: 
To score the entities' contribution to the question on a scale from 0 to 1, I would give the following scores:

* Autonomous Republic of Crimea: 0.0 (it's not a major city in Ukraine, but a disputed region)
* Cherkasy Oblast: 0.05 (it's a region in Ukraine, but not a major city)
* Sevastopol: 0.2 (it's a city in Ukraine, but not one of the major cities)
* Ternopil Oblast: 0.05 (it's a region in Ukraine, but not a major city)
* Zhytomyr Oblast: 0.05 (it's a region in Ukraine, but not a major city)

The sum of the scores is 0.35, which means the maximum score would be 1 - 0.35 = 0.65.

Note that the question asks for "major cities" in Ukraine, so I've given higher scores to Sevastopol, which is a city, compared to the regions (oblasts). However, Sevastopol is not one of the major cities in Ukraine, so I've given it a relatively low score. The actual major cities in Ukraine are not among the given entities, so the scores are relatively low across the board.

These relations are highly relevant as they directly relate to the question about who plays Charlie in the Santa Clause movies. The `film.starring` relation provides a list of actors who have starred in the film, which is likely to include the answer to the question. The `film.film.starring` relation is also relevant as it provides additional information about the film, including its cast. The `film.casting_director.films_casting_directed` relation is less relevant but still provides some context about the casting director who worked on the film, which could be useful in understanding the casting process.

RESULT: 
I'd be happy to help you score the entities' contribution to the question.

The question is "who were Mary Shelley?" and the relation is "book.author.works_written". This suggests that the entities provided are works written by Mary Shelley.

Let's score the entities based on their relevance to the question:

* El Mortal Inmortal y Otras Historias: 0.0 (not a well-known work by Mary Shelley, and the title doesn't seem to match her style)
* Lives of the most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain, and Portugal, Vol. II: 0.0 (this appears to be a biography or historical work, not a novel or literary work by Mary Shelley)
* Maurice: 0.8 (Maurice is a novel by Mary Shelley, so this entity is highly relevant to the question)
* Maurice O La Cabana Del Pescador: 0.0 (this appears to be a Spanish translation of Maurice, but it's not a distinct work, so I'll score it 0)
* Mounseer Nongtongpaw: 0.0 (this appears to be a character from a novel, but it's not a work written by Mary Shelley, so I'll score it 0)

The sum of the scores is 0.8 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 = 0.8, so the scores are normalized to:

* El Mortal Inmortal y Otras Historias: 0.0
* Lives of the most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain, and Portugal, Vol. II: 0.0
* Maurice: 0.8
* Maurice O La Cabana Del Pescador: 0.0
* Mounseer Nongtongpaw: 0.0

The highest-scoring entity is Maurice, which is a novel written by Mary Shelley.

2. {base.ontologies.ontology_instance_mapping.ontology (Score: 0.3)}: This relation is moderately relevant as it provides information on the ontology instance of the Arizona Cardinals stadium, which could help narrow down the search for the location.
3. {base.ontologies.ontology.equivalent_instances (Score: 0.1)}: This relation is less relevant as it provides information on equivalent instances of the Arizona Cardinals stadium, which may not be directly related to the location.

Note that the scores are subjective and based on my understanding of the question and the relations provided. The actual relevance of the relations may vary depending on the context and the specific information available.

For the second question, since it's about Wayne Gretzky's first team, I couldn't find any relevant relations related to the topic entity "UnName_Entity" (as there is no entity specified). The relations provided are related to measurement units, which are not relevant to the question. Therefore, I would rate the relations as:

1. (Score: 0) - No relation is relevant to the question.

RESULT: 
To score the entities' contribution to the question, I will analyze the relation and the entities provided.

The relation is "ice_hockey.hockey_position.players", which suggests that the question is about a player in the game of ice hockey.

The entities are all players, but the question asks about Wayne Gretzky's first team. Therefore, I will score the entities based on their relevance to Wayne Gretzky's career.

* Bruce Major: 0.0 (not a relevant entity)
* Carl Corazzini: 0.0 (not a relevant entity)
* John Tucker: 0.0 (not a relevant entity)
* Mikael Backlund: 0.0 (not a relevant entity)
* Peter Mahovlich: 0.0 (not a relevant entity)

The correct answer is not among the provided entities. Wayne Gretzky's first team was the Edmonton Oilers. Therefore, the score for all entities is 0.

The sum of the scores is 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 = 0.0, which is correct, as none of the entities matched the criteria.

A: 

RESULT: 
I'd be happy to help!

For the first question, the three relations that contribute to the answer are:

language.human_language.main_country; language.human_language.countries_spoken_in; base.rosetta.languoid.parent

With the following scores:

1. language.human_language.main_country (Score: 0.4)
2. language.human_language.countries_spoken_in (Score: 0.3)
3. base.rosetta.languoid.parent (Score: 0.2)

These relations are relevant because they provide information about the country where Brahui is spoken, which is crucial in finding the president of that country in 1980.

For the second question, the relation that contributes to the answer is:

law.judicial_title.judges

With a score of 1.0 (since it's the only relevant relation).

This relation is highly relevant because it directly answers the question about the judges appointed in the supreme court, providing the list of judges.

Score: 

RESULT: 
To score the entities' contribution to the question, I will assign a score of 1 to the entity that matches the given criteria and 0 to the entities that do not match.

The question asks about countries that have English as their official language. Upon checking, I found that the following countries have English as their official language:

* Australia
* Canada
* Kingdom of Great Britain (United Kingdom)
* New Zealand
* Republic of Ireland
* United States of America

All of these countries have English as one of their official languages, so I will assign a score of 1 to each of them. Therefore, the scores are:

* Australia: 1.0
* Canada: 1.0
* Kingdom of Great Britain (United Kingdom): 1.0
* New Zealand: 1.0
* Republic of Ireland: 1.0
* United States of America: 1.0

The sum of the scores is 6.0, which is greater than 1.0. To normalize the scores, I will divide each score by 6.0, which gives:

* Australia: 0.1667
* Canada: 0.1667
* Kingdom of Great Britain (United Kingdom): 0.1667
* New Zealand: 0.1667
* Republic of Ireland: 0.1667
* United States of America: 0.1667

The sum of the normalized scores is 1.0.

Here are the top 3 relations that contribute to the question "Who are the senators of Hawaii 2012?" separated by semicolons, along with their contribution scores:

kg.object_profile.prominent_type; location.administrative_division.capital; location.us_county.hud_county_place (Score: 0.6)

These relations are highly relevant as they provide information on the administrative divisions and political entities in Hawaii, which is crucial for identifying the senators. The "prominent type" relation helps to establish that Kalawao County is a county in Hawaii, while the "capital" relation provides the capital of Hawaii, which is Honolulu, and the "Hud county place" relation gives the county seat of Kalawao County, which is Kalaupapa.

location.administrative_division.second_level_division_of; location.administrative_division.fips_10_4_region_code (Score: 0.3)

These relations are moderately relevant as they provide additional information on the administrative divisions and codes related to Hawaii, which could be useful in narrowing down the search for the senators.

base.aareas.schema.administrative_area.administrative_area_type (Score: 0.1)

This relation is less relevant as it provides general information on the type of administrative area, which is not directly related to the question of identifying the senators.

RESULT: 
Here are the top 3 relations that contribute to the question, separated by semicolons, with their corresponding scores:

location.us_county.county_seat; location.us_county.hud_county_place; location.us_county.hud_section_8_area; (Score: 0.6)

The first relation, location.us_county.county_seat, is highly relevant as it directly relates to the senators of Hawaii, as the county seat is often the location of the county government and may be where the senators are elected or have their offices.

The second relation, location.us_county.hud_county_place, is also highly relevant as it provides information on the county where the senators are elected or have their offices.

The third relation, location.us_county.hud_section_8_area, is less relevant but still provides some context on the county's demographics and socioeconomic conditions, which may be useful in understanding the senators' priorities and constituents.

Note that the scores add up to 0.6, which means that these three relations are the most relevant and important for answering the question.

RESULT: 
The question is asking for the senators of Hawaii in 2012, but the topic entity is Nebraska. This is a mismatch, as Nebraska is not the relevant entity for this question. Therefore, none of the relations provided are relevant to the question.

However, if we assume that the question is asking for the senators of Hawaii in 2012, the relevant relations would be:

1. {government.government_office_or_title.jurisdiction (Score: 0.6)}: This relation is highly relevant as it directly relates to the office of the senators and their jurisdiction.
2. {government.government_position_held.district_represented (Score: 0.3)}: This relation is also relevant as it provides information on the district represented by the senators.
3. {base.ontologies.ontology_instance.equivalent_instances (Score: 0.1)}: This relation is less relevant but still provides some context on the ontology instance of the senators.

Note that the scores are arbitrary and based on the assumption that the question is asking for the senators of Hawaii in 2012.

2. language.human_language.countries_spoken_in (Score: 0.3)
3. kg.object_profile.prominent_type (Score: 0.1)

The first relation, language.human_language.main_country, is the most relevant as it directly relates to the country whose president is being asked for, and the main country where Brahui language is spoken in 1980.

The second relation, language.human_language.countries_spoken_in, is also relevant as it provides information on the countries where Brahui language is spoken, which could help narrow down the search for the president.

The third relation, kg.object_profile.prominent_type, is less relevant but still provides some context on the prominence of the entity being asked about, which could be useful in understanding the context of the question.

Note that the sum of the scores is 1, indicating that these three relations are the most relevant and important for answering the question.

I'd be happy to help!

For the first question, the three relations that contribute to the answer are:

language.human_language.main_country; language.human_language.countries_spoken_in; base.rosetta.languoid.parent

I would rate their contribution as follows:

1. language.human_language.main_country: 0.6 (This relation is highly relevant as it directly relates to the country whose president is being asked for, and the main country where Brahui language is spoken in 1980.)
2. language.human_language.countries_spoken_in: 0.3 (This relation is also relevant as it provides information on the countries where Brahui language is spoken, which could help narrow down the search for the president.)
3. base.rosetta.languoid.parent: 0.1 (This relation is less relevant but still provides some context on the language family to which Brahui belongs, which could be useful in understanding the linguistic and cultural background of the country in question.)

The sum of these scores is 1.

For the second question, the three relations that contribute to the answer are:

education.education.institution; education.education.student; education.educational_institution.students_graduates

I would rate their contribution as follows:

1. education.education.institution: 0.5 (This relation is relevant as it provides information on the educational institution Dr. Seuss attended or worked at.)
2. education.education.student: 0.3 (This relation is somewhat relevant as it implies that Dr. Seuss was a student at some point in his life.)
3. education.educational_institution.students_graduates: 0.2 (This relation is less relevant as it is more focused on the students who graduated from a particular institution, rather than the institution itself or Dr. Seuss's education.)

The sum of these scores is 1.

I would rate their contribution as follows:

1. language.human_language.main_country (Score: 0.6) - This relation is highly relevant as it directly relates to the country whose president is being asked for, and the main country where Brahui language is spoken in 1980.
2. language.human_language.countries_spoken_in (Score: 0.3) - This relation is also relevant as it provides information on the countries where Brahui language is spoken, which could help narrow down the search for the president.
3. base.rosetta.languoid.parent (Score: 0.1) - This relation is less relevant as it provides general information about the language family to which Brahui belongs, but it's not directly related to the president of the country.

The sum of the scores is 1, as required.

As for the second question, since there is no specific topic entity provided, I assume you are asking about Judi Dench's spouse. The relevant relation is:

base.popstra.friendship.participant

I would rate its contribution as 1, as it directly relates to Judi Dench's marriage.

1. A Monograph of the Sub-class Cirripedia, with Figures of all the Species. The Lepadidae; or, Pedunculated Cirripedes. - Score: 1.0 (This is a book written by Charles Darwin, so it's a perfect match.)
2. A Monograph on the Fossil Lepadidae, or, Pedunculated Cirripedes of Great Britain - Score: 1.0 (Another book written by Charles Darwin, another perfect match.)
3. Geological Observations on the Volcanic Islands - Score: 0.0 (This is a book, but it's not written by Charles Darwin, so it's not a match.)
4. The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom - Score: 1.0 (Another book written by Charles Darwin, another perfect match.)
5. Viaje de Un Naturalista Alrededor del Mundo 2 Vol - Score: 0.0 (This is a book, but it's not written by Charles Darwin, so it's not a match.)

The sum of the scores is 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 = 3.0. Since the sum is not equal to 1, I'll normalize the scores by dividing each score by the sum:

1.0 / 3.0 = 0.33
1.0 / 3.0 = 0.33
0.0 / 3.0 = 0.0
1.0 / 3.0 = 0.33
0.0 / 3.0 = 0.0

The normalized scores are 0.33, 0.33, 0.0, 0.33, and 0.0.

Here are the three relations that contribute to the question, separated by semicolons, along with their contribution scores:

base.aareas.schema.administrative_area.capital; base.biblioness.bibs_location.country; base.popstra.location.vacationers; (Score: 0.7)

These relations are highly relevant as they provide information on the administrative division (Kauai, Hawaii) and its capital, which is a crucial piece of information for determining the current time. The vacationers relation is also relevant as it provides context on the popularity of the location.

base.aareas.schema.administrative_area.administrative_parent; base.aareas.schema.administrative_area.administrative_children; (Score: 0.2)

These relations are somewhat relevant as they provide information on the administrative hierarchy of Kauai, Hawaii, which could be useful in understanding the location's context.

base.ontologies.ontology_instance.equivalent_instances; (Score: 0.1)

This relation is less relevant as it provides general information on equivalent instances, which is not directly related to the question of determining the current time in Kauai, Hawaii.

I'm happy to help!

For the first question, the relations that contribute to the answer are:

1. {language.human_language.main_country (Score: 0.4)}: This relation is highly relevant as it directly relates to the country whose president is being asked for, and the main country where Brahui language is spoken in 1980.
2. {language.human_language.countries_spoken_in (Score: 0.3)}: This relation is also relevant as it provides information on the countries where Brahui language is spoken, which could help narrow down the search for the president.
3. {base.rosetta.languoid.parent (Score: 0.2)}: This relation is less relevant but still provides some context on the language family to which Brahui belongs, which could be useful in understanding the linguistic and cultural background of the country in question.

The total score is 0.9, as the sum of the scores is 0.4 + 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.9.

As for the second question, I couldn't find any relevant relations that directly answer the question about the current time in Kauai, Hawaii. The relations provided seem to be related to geography, mystery, and other topics, but not time or current events. Therefore, I would rate the relevance of the relations as 0.0, as they do not contribute to answering the question.

RESULT: 
Based on the provided relations, I would rate the top 3 relations that contribute to the question as follows:

1. {location.geolocation (Score: 0.6)}: This relation is highly relevant as it directly provides the current time in Kauai, Hawaii, which is the main topic of the question.
2. {time.time_zone.locations_in_this_time_zone (Score: 0.3)}: This relation is also relevant as it provides information on the time zone of Kauai, Hawaii, which could help determine the current time.
3. {location.location.area (Score: 0.1)}: This relation is less relevant but still provides some context on the location of Kauai, Hawaii, which could be useful in understanding the context of the question.

Note that the scores are subjective and based on my understanding of the question and the provided relations. The total score of the top 3 relations is 0.9, which means that the remaining relations are not as relevant to the question.

2. language.human_language.countries_spoken_in: 0.33
3. base.rosetta.languoid.parent: 0.23

For the second question, the three relations that contribute to the answer are:

location.geocode.latitude; location.geocode.longitude; UnName_Entity (Note: There is no entity named "UnName_Entity", so I assume you meant to ask about the current time in Kauai, Hawaii. If that's the case, the correct entity is "Kauai")

Since there is no relevant information about "UnName_Entity", I'll consider the question as unclear. If you meant to ask about Kauai, Hawaii, I can provide the current time. However, please note that I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time information, and the current time may not be accurate.

RESULT: 
To score the entities' contribution to the question, I will give a score of 1 to the entity that matches the given criteria, and 0 to the entities that do not match.

The question is "what does Bolivia border?" and the entities are administrative divisions of Bolivia.

Since Bolivia is a country, it has borders with other countries, not administrative divisions. Therefore, none of the given entities match the criteria.

So, the score for all entities would be 0. The sum of the scores is also 0, which is correct since the sum of the scores of all entities should be 1.

Score: 

RESULT: 
To score the entities' contribution to the question, I'll assign a score of 1 to the entity that matches the given criteria, and 0 to the entities that do not match.

The question is "what does Bolivia border?", so I'll look for the entity that is an administrative division of Bolivia.

The entity "Beni Department" is not a bordering entity, so its score is 0.

The entity "Chuquisaca" is not a bordering entity, so its score is 0.

The entity "Cochabamba" is not a bordering entity, so its score is 0.

The entity "La Paz" is not a bordering entity, so its score is 0.

The entity "Litoral Department" is not a bordering entity, so its score is 0.

The entity "Oruro Department" is not a bordering entity, so its score is 0.

The entity "Pando Department" is not a bordering entity, so its score is 0.

The entity "Potosí" is not a bordering entity, so its score is 0.

The entity "Santa Cruz Department" is not a bordering entity, so its score is 0.

The entity "Tarija Department" is not a bordering entity, so its score is 0.

However, Bolivia is bordered by several countries, including Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Argentina, and Peru. Unfortunately, these entities are not listed.

Since none of the given entities match the criteria, I would score all entities as 0. The sum of the scores is 0, which is correct since the entities do not contribute to the answer.

Based on my knowledge, Bolivia is a country located in South America, and it borders several countries. According to my information, Bolivia shares borders with:

* Argentina to the south
* Brazil to the north and east
* Chile to the southwest
* Paraguay and Argentina to the southeast
* Peru to the west

Among the entities you provided, none of them are countries that border Bolivia. Therefore, I would score each of them as 0.0, since they are not relevant to the question.

The total score would be:

0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 = 0.0

Since the sum of the scores should be 1, I would adjust the scores to:

RESULT: 
Based on the given information, I would score the entities' contribution to the question on a scale from 0 to 1 as follows:

* Pickering: 0.6
* Toronto: 0.4

The reason for this scoring is that Pickering is a city that is known for its water treatment plants and is a major source of Toronto's water supply. Toronto, on the other hand, is the city that gets its water from Pickering, so it is also relevant to the question. However, Pickering is more directly related to the question, as it is the primary source of Toronto's water, so it gets a slightly higher score.

RESULT: 
Based on the provided topic entity "Argentina" and the given relations, I would rate the contributions as follows:

1. {location.country.languages_spoken (Score: 0.6)}: This relation is highly relevant as it directly answers the question about the most common language spoken in Argentina.
2. {location.country.official_language (Score: 0.3)}: This relation is also relevant as it provides additional information about the official language of Argentina, which could help narrow down the search for the most common language spoken.
3. {kg.object_profile.prominent_type (Score: 0.1)}: This relation is less relevant as it provides general information about the prominent type of the entity, which is not directly related to the question about the most common language spoken in Argentina.

Note that the scores are subjective and based on the context of the question and the provided relations. The total score of the three relations adds up to 1, as required.

Score: 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0
The movie that matches the given criteria is "So Undercover" with Miley Cyrus and produced by Tobin Armbrust. Therefore, the score for "So Undercover" would be 1, and the scores for all other entities would be 0.

Q: what is the most common language spoken in argentina?
Relation: location.country.languages_spoken
Entites: Guaraní language; Italian Language; Quechuan languages; Spanish Language; Yiddish Language
Score: 

RESULT: 
Based on the information available, I would score the entities' contribution to the question on a scale from 0 to 1 as follows:

* Guaraní language: 0.0
* Italian Language: 0.0
* Quechuan languages: 0.0
* Spanish Language: 0.9
* Yiddish Language: 0.1

The reason for this scoring is that Spanish is the most widely spoken language in Argentina, and it is the official language of the country. Guaraní, Italian, Quechuan languages, and Yiddish are not as widely spoken in Argentina, and therefore have a lower score.

RESULT: 
Here are the three relations that contribute to the question, separated by semicolons, along with their scores on a scale from 0 to 1:

language.human_language.main_country; language.human_language.countries_spoken_in; government.us_vice_president.to_president; (Score: 0.7; 0.2; 0.1)

The relation "language.human_language.main_country" is the most relevant, as it directly relates to the country whose president is being asked for, and the main country where Brahui language is spoken in 1980. The relation "language.human_language.countries_spoken_in" is also relevant, as it provides information on the countries where Brahui language is spoken, which could help narrow down the search for the president. The relation "government.us_vice_president.to_president" is less relevant, but still provides some context on the presidential succession after John F. Kennedy's death.

I'm happy to help!

However, I noticed that the question doesn't mention any specific topic entity, and the relations provided don't seem to be relevant to the question. The question asks about the types of religions in the United States, but the relations provided are related to pronunciation in Japanese.

To answer this question, I would suggest using relations such as:

1. {base.schemastaging.religion.subcategory (Score: 0.6)}: This relation is highly relevant as it provides information on the subcategories of religions, which could help identify the types of religions in the United States.
2. {base.schemastaging.religion.category (Score: 0.3)}: This relation is also relevant as it provides information on the categories of religions, which could help narrow down the search for the types of religions in the United States.
3. {base.schemastaging.religion.country (Score: 0.1)}: This relation is less relevant but still provides some context on the country where the religions are practiced, which could be useful in understanding the cultural and societal context of the religions.

Please note that the scores are subjective and may vary depending on the specific context and requirements of the question.

Score: 

RESULT: 
To score the entities' contribution to the question, I'll calculate the similarity between each entity and the question. Since the question asks for the names of Harry Potter movies in order, I'll give more weight to entities that are part of the Harry Potter film series.

Here's the scoring:

1. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - 0.2 (it's a Harry Potter movie, but not the first one)
2. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part I - 0.3 (it's a Harry Potter movie and part of the later half of the series)
3. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 - 0.4 (it's a Harry Potter movie and the final part of the series)
4. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - 0.3 (it's a Harry Potter movie and part of the middle of the series)
5. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - 0.3 (it's a Harry Potter movie and part of the middle of the series)
6. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - 0.3 (it's a Harry Potter movie and part of the middle of the series)
7. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - 0.4 (it's the first Harry Potter movie)
8. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - 0.3 (it's a Harry Potter movie and part of the early half of the series)

The sum of the scores is 1.9, which means the scores can be adjusted to add up to 1. To do this, I'll multiply each score by 0.52 (1/1.9). Here are the adjusted scores:

1. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - 0.104
2. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part I - 0.156
3. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 - 0.208
4. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - 0.156
5. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - 0.156
6. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - 0.156
7. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone - 0.208
8. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - 0.156

The highest score belongs to "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", which is the first movie in the series.

I'd be happy to help!

For the first question, the three relations that contribute to the answer are:

language.human_language.main_country; language.human_language.countries_spoken_in; base.rosetta.languoid.parent

I would rate their contribution as follows:

1. language.human_language.main_country (Score: 0.6) - This relation is highly relevant as it directly answers the question about the president of the country where Brahui is the main spoken language.
2. language.human_language.countries_spoken_in (Score: 0.3) - This relation is also relevant as it provides additional information about the countries where Brahui is spoken, which could help narrow down the search for the president.
3. base.rosetta.languoid.parent (Score: 0.1) - This relation is less relevant as it provides general information about the language family to which Brahui belongs, but it's not directly related to the question.

The sum of the scores is 1.

For the second question, since it's a general question about what to do in Manchester with kids, there are no specific relations that are directly relevant. However, if I had to choose three relations that could potentially contribute to the answer, I would choose:

base.ontologies.ontology_instance_mapping.freebase_topic; base.ontologies.ontology_instance_mapping.ontology; base.ontologies.ontology.equivalent_instances

I would rate their contribution as follows:

1. base.ontologies.ontology_instance_mapping.freebase_topic (Score: 0.4) - This relation could potentially provide information about Manchester's attractions and activities that are suitable for families with kids.
2. base.ontologies.ontology_instance_mapping.ontology (Score: 0.3) - This relation could provide information about the types of activities and events that are popular in Manchester, which could be relevant for families with kids.
3. base.ontologies.ontology.equivalent_instances (Score: 0.3) - This relation could provide information about similar cities or destinations that are known for their family-friendly activities, which could be useful for planning a trip to Manchester.

Note that these relations are not directly relevant to the question, but they could potentially provide some useful information.
